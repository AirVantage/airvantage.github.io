At AirVantage, we have a passion for open source. Not only do we 
We want this brand new website to be a way to engage with our community of developpers and users. 

Let me give you a quick tour of what we have in stock for you!

API Examples
------------

[AirVantage M2M Cloud](http://na.airvantage.net) provides a rich set of API for managing your devices on the field. We are delivering [open source examples](http://airvantage.github.io/api) helping you to access AirVantage API from your language of choice, including the OAuth authentication process.

Tutorials
---------

Our [tutorials](http://airvantage.github.io/tutorials) give you the opportunity to go in depth on specific topics, with detailed explanations and, again, open source code that you can use to get started even quicker.

Cool projects
-------------

When we are not working hard on making AirVantage the coolest M2M platform, we also hack on some cool projects of our own and guess what... they are open source too!<br>
Don't wait any longer to go [check out](http://airvantage.github.io/projects) the great projects we have already. 

A cool developer kit
---------------------

If you want to evaluate AirVantage and you are not sure yet what kind of physical objects you would like to connect to it –or maybe you simply don't have these objects at hand just yet– you might want to have a look at our <span style="font-family: 'aruallight';">eclo</span> developer kit. Check the [dedicated page](http://airvantage.github.io/devkit) to learn more, see a live demo, and possibly order your very own greenhouse kit!
