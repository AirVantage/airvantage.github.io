Number two in our list of top features this new AirVantage Enterprise Platform version is the added support of <strong>webhooks</strong>.
</p>

Webhooks are a very simple (some would say <a href="http://blog.iron.io/2013/09/7-reasons-webhooks-are-magic.html" target="_blank">magic</a>!) way of pushing events to an external application. <br/>
In an AVEP context, it means that you can notify an external application of an event that occured in AirVantage.

As of today, you can associate a webhook to an Alert Rule. It will be called when the condition specified in the rule is met, allowing you to notify a 3rd party app immediately for e.g. logging the alert, create an entry in a Google Calendar, etc.

Note that this feature is provided in __beta__, and we are looking forward to hearing from you in order to improve it. Please use the "Feedback" button from the AirVantage UI or ping us on <a href="https://twitter.com/AirVantage" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you have suggestions.

See you tomorrow to talk about the #1 feature that we are very excited to unveil!
